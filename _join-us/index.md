## Current Research Projects

<div class="projects-intro" markdown="1">
To get an idea of the kind of projects we are interested in, please have a look at our current research topics (see [Research](/research)). Also, below are some of the ongoing research projects:

### Soft Matter Singularities

<div class="projects-grid" markdown="1">

<div class="project-card" markdown="1">

### From Champagne to Coughs: Modelling Droplet Formation

Investigate how bubbles burst in complex fluids that behave like both liquids and elastic solids — from volcanic mudpots to respiratory mucus. Using Basilisk C simulations, discover how viscosity and elasticity control jet formation and droplet ejection when bubble cavities collapse. Map regimes where elastic stresses suppress or enhance jetting, with experimental validation from collaborators at Twente and Delft.

<div class="project-card" markdown="1">

### Instability Dynamics of Flowing Liquid Films: Plates and Fibers

Thin films transition between instability regimes as inclination varies. Use Basilisk CFD to map stability boundaries, characterize wave dynamics via spectral analysis, and study coupling between Kapitza, Rayleigh–Taylor, and Rayleigh–Plateau instabilities.

<div class="project-card" markdown="1">

### Sneezing Droplets: Modelling Respiratory Droplet Formation

Numerically investigate how viscoelasticity affects filament breakup — the second stage of droplet formation. Simulate viscoelastic filaments, compare with Newtonian benchmarks, and improve predictions of droplet size distributions in respiratory events.

<div class="project-card" markdown="1">

### Holey Sheets: Bursting of Liquid Films

Test how submicron impurities trigger hole nucleation in micron‑thick sheets. Using CLSVOF in Basilisk C, simulate radial drainage flows to reveal a double threshold for breakup and develop scaling laws for hole formation relevant to aerosols and sprays.

### Free-Surface Flows

<div class="project-card" markdown="1">

### Drops and Bubbles Spreading on Lubricant-Infused Surfaces

Liquid-infused surfaces enable control over fluid spreading. Use Basilisk's adaptive VOF solver to capture capillary-wave cascades when fluids contact LIS, map spreading regimes, and reveal how wave convergence entrains secondary droplets. Develop scaling laws with experimental partners at TU Delft and Univ. Twente.

### Playing Ping-Pong with Liquid Droplets

Simulate droplet bouncing on superhydrophobic surfaces — from Scott Kelly's space ping‑pong to hydrodynamic singularities. Map bouncing regimes, quantify force profiles and dissipation, and study Worthington jet formation with high-fidelity CFD.

### Gravity‑Defying Liquids: Thermoresponsive Viscoplastic Gels

Study hot droplet impacts on cold substrates in gels transitioning from Newtonian to yield‑stress behavior. Implement temperature‑dependent rheology in DNS and correlate with experimental data for printing applications.
