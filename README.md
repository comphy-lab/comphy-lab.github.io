   - Card images (600x400px): Used on the main teaching page
   - Banner images (1200x400px): Used on individual course pages
   - Follow naming convention: `[course-name]-[location].[extension]`

### Search Functionality
The website includes a powerful search feature that allows users to:
- Search through all content including titles, text, and tags
- Get instant search results with highlighted matching text
- See match percentage for each result
- Navigate directly to specific sections using anchor links
- Access search via keyboard shortcut (⌘K on Mac, ctrl+K on Windows) or by clicking the magnifying glass icon in the navigation

Search results are prioritized and filtered as follows:
1. Team Members (highest priority)
   - Direct matches in names
   - Research interests and affiliations
   - Social media links and profile information
2. Teaching Content
   - Course titles and descriptions
   - Course details (dates, locations, prerequisites)
   - Course schedules and topics
3. Research Papers
   - Titles and authors
   - Tags and categories
4. Blog Posts from [blogs.comphy-lab.org](https://blogs.comphy-lab.org)
   - Indexed directly from the GitHub repository (comphy-lab/CoMPhy-Lab-Blogs)
   - Only indexes markdown files where the publish flag is not set to false
   - Excludes todo markdown files (case-insensitive)
   - Updated automatically every 12 hours via GitHub Actions
5. Regular content (headings and paragraphs)

The search database is maintained in a separate repository [comphy-lab/comphy-search](https://github.com/comphy-lab/comphy-search) and is automatically updated in this website via GitHub Actions. This approach:
- Centralizes search database generation in a dedicated repository
- Ensures consistent search functionality across the website
- Automatically updates the search database daily or when content changes
- Simplifies maintenance by separating search logic from the website code

### Command Palette Functionality
The website includes a command palette feature that provides quick access to actions and navigation through keyboard shortcuts:

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Access via ⌘K on Mac, ctrl+K on Windows, or by clicking the terminal icon in the navigation
- **Navigation Commands**: Quickly navigate to any section of the website
- **External Link Commands**: Direct access to GitHub, Google Scholar, YouTube, and Bluesky
- **Tool Commands**: Scroll to top/bottom and other utility functions
- **Context-Aware Commands**: Additional commands appear based on current page
- **Search Integration**: Search is available separately via the ⌘K shortcut
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate through commands, Enter to select, and Esc to close

Key features:
- Custom implementation with vanilla JavaScript for better control and performance
- Different visual styling from search to avoid confusion (indigo accent color vs blue for search)
- Grouping of commands by section for easy discoverability
- Shortcuts for common tasks (g h = go home, g r = go to research, etc.)
- Full keyboard navigation with arrow keys, Enter, and Escape
- Footer with keyboard shortcut hints for better usability

The command palette is built with:
- Custom vanilla JavaScript implementation
- Responsive and accessible design
- Integration with the site search database for content discovery
- Complete keyboard navigation support

Files:
- `/assets/js/command-data.js`: Defines all available commands and search database integration
- `/assets/css/command-palette.css`: Styling for the command palette

Search behavior and features:
- Minimum query length: 2 characters
- Keyboard shortcut (⌘K / ctrl+K) opens a command palette style search interface on all pages
- Magnifying glass icon in navigation opens the search interface when clicked
- Search input in navigation shows the full "⌘K (search)" text by default
- Custom command palette implementation provides a modern command palette experience
- Search results appear instantly as you type
- Results are ranked by relevance and match percentage

### External Blog Integration
The search functionality includes content from our external blog at blogs.comphy-lab.org:
- Blog posts are fetched and indexed in the comphy-search repository
- Each post's title and content are searchable
- Results link directly to the blog post
- Blog content is refreshed with each update to the search database

### Tags System
Research papers can be tagged with multiple topics. Tags are defined in the markdown files using the following format:
```html
<tags><span>Tag1</span><span>Tag2</span></tags>
```

These tags are:
- Displayed with each paper
- Searchable through the search interface
- Used for filtering papers by topic
- Included in search match percentage calculations

## Part B: Back-End Documentation

### Configuration and Layouts
- `_config.yml`: Site-wide settings, collections, build options
- Layout Templates in `_layouts/`
- Partial Includes in `_includes/`
- Assets in `assets/`

### Theme Toggle

The website supports both light and dark themes with an easy toggle switch in the header navigation:

1. **Theme Preferences**
   - Automatically detects user's system preference (light/dark mode)
   - Remembers user's manual selection using localStorage
   - Maintains theme consistency across page navigation

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Theme toggle button in the header of all layouts (default, team, research, teaching, teaching-course)
   - CSS variables for theme colors in `styles.css` and page-specific stylesheets
   - JavaScript to handle theme switching and user preferences

3. **Customizing Theme Colors**
   - Light and dark theme variables are defined in `assets/css/styles.css`
   - Page-specific theme colors in respective CSS files (research.css, teaching.css, team.css)
   - Theme is applied using the `data-theme` attribute on the HTML element

### Design Elements
- **Color Scheme**
  - Gradient text (Red to Blue) for lab name
  - Warm orange tint + blur for header
  - Dark theme support with adjusted colors for better night viewing
- **Theme Toggle**
  - Located in the header next to the Google Scholar icon
  - Switches between light (default) and dark themes
  - Uses SVG icons (moon/sun) with smooth transitions
  - Persists user preference via localStorage
  - Falls back to system preference when no user selection exists
- **Typography**
  - Libre Baskerville, Open Sans
  - Gradients for emphasis
  - White text in dark theme for improved readability
- **Favicon**
  - Located in `/assets/favicon/`
  - Multiple sizes for different devices and browsers

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The website uses three GitHub Actions workflows for automation:

1. **Jekyll site CI** (`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`)
   - Builds and deploys the Jekyll website
   - Triggers on push/PR to main branch
   - Two-step process:
     1. Builds site and generates artifacts
     2. Deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Uses latest Ruby and Jekyll versions

2. **pages-build-deployment** (GitHub-managed)
   - Built-in GitHub Pages deployment workflow
   - Handles final deployment to GitHub's servers
   - Works automatically with Jekyll CI workflow
   - Provides deployment status and URLs

3. **Update Search Database** (`.github/workflows/update-search.yml`)
   - Maintains site's search functionality
   - Triggers:
     - Daily at 4:00 UTC automatically
     - On content file changes (MD/HTML)
     - Manual trigger available
   - Fetches the search database from [comphy-lab/comphy-search](https://github.com/comphy-lab/comphy-search)
   - Updates `search_db.json` in the website repository
   - Commits changes back to repository

These workflows work together to ensure:
- Automated site builds and deployments
- Up-to-date search functionality
- Consistent deployment to GitHub Pages

3. **Blog Content Indexing**
   - Blog content from [blogs.comphy-lab.org](https://blogs.comphy-lab.org) is indexed in the [comphy-search](https://github.com/comphy-lab/comphy-search) repository
   - Source: [comphy-lab/CoMPhy-Lab-Blogs](https://github.com/comphy-lab/CoMPhy-Lab-Blogs)
   - Filtering criteria:
     - Only indexes markdown files where `publish: false` is NOT set in frontmatter
     - Automatically excludes any files with "todo" in the filename (case-insensitive)
   - The search index is automatically updated:
     - Daily via GitHub Actions
     - When changes are pushed to markdown or HTML files
     - Can be manually triggered from the Actions tab
   - This approach improves search quality by:
     - Centralizing search database generation
     - Accessing the raw markdown directly from the source
     - Respecting publish status in frontmatter
     - Processing content in a more structured way
     - Avoiding web scraping issues or rate limits
