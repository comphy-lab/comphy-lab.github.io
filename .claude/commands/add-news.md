Add the following news item to both News.md and history.md:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Parse the news content from $ARGUMENTS
2. Determine the appropriate month and year (ask if unclear)
3. Read both News.md and history.md files
4. Add the news item to history.md in the correct chronological position:
   - Years are sorted descending (newest first)
   - Months within a year are in chronological order
   - Format: `- [news content]`
5. Add the same item to News.md:
   - Find the correct month/year section (create if needed)
   - Insert after the month heading
   - Preserve the pinned Durham announcement (no month header)
6. Count non-pinned news items in News.md
7. If more than 5 items exist, remove the oldest ones
8. Ensure proper spacing between sections
9. Save both files

Important formatting:

- News items start with "- "
- Leave blank lines between different news items
- The pinned item has no "### Month" header above it
- Month headers use format: ### Month (e.g., ### May)
