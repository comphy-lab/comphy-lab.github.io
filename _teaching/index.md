# Teaching

Welcome to the CoMPhy Lab's educational resources. Apart from the university courses, we aim to develop and offer a range of workshops and tutorials on modern computational methods for multiphase flows and high-fidelity simulations.

## About Our Teaching Philosophy

At CoMPhy Lab, we believe in hands-on learning and deep understanding of computational methods. Our courses combine theoretical foundations with practical implementation, allowing students to develop both conceptual understanding and technical skills.

Our teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Think before you compute**: Understanding the underlying physics before implementation
- **Modular code structure**: Building maintainable and extensible computational tools
- **Advanced numerical methods**: Mastering state-of-the-art techniques for complex problems
- **Open science**: Sharing knowledge and tools with the scientific community. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/comphy-lab"><i class="fa-brands fa-github" style="font-size: 1.5em; color: black; font-style: normal;"></i></a>
