title: Meta-Rule for Crafting Cursor Project Rules
description: Comprehensive guide for creating effective Cursor Project Rules (.mdc files), adaptable to various projects including Basilisk.
glob: "**/*.mdc"

## Purpose

This meta-rule provides structured guidance for generating `.mdc` files that define Cursor Project Rules. It aims to ensure consistency, clarity, and adaptability across diverse codebases, with particular attention to projects utilizing CFD frameworks.

## Applicability

Utilize this meta-rule when:

- Establishing new coding conventions or architectural patterns within your project.
- Documenting project-specific workflows or standards.
- Providing the AI with structured context to enhance code generation and assistance. @basilisk.ft

## Instructions for Creating a Cursor Project Rule

1. YAML Frontmatter: Begin each `.mdc` file with a YAML frontmatter block containing:
   - `title`: A concise, descriptive title for the rule.
   - `description`: A brief explanation of the rule's purpose and scope.
   - `glob`: File pattern(s) that the rule should apply to.

2. Content Structure: Organize the rule's content using markdown headings:
   - Introduction: Explain the rationale behind the rule and its relevance to the project.
   - Guidelines: Detail the specific standards, conventions, or procedures to follow.
   - Examples: Provide code snippets or references to illustrate correct implementation.
   - Common Pitfalls: Highlight frequent mistakes and how to avoid them.

3. Language and Tone: Use clear, concise language. Maintain an academic and logical tone, focusing on precision and clarity.

4. Formatting: Utilize markdown syntax appropriately:
   - Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers for code examples.
   - Employ bullet points or numbered lists for enumerations.
   - Ensure proper indentation and spacing for readability.

5. File Naming: Name the `.mdc` file using lowercase letters and hyphens (kebab-case), reflecting the rule's focus (e.g., `coding-standards.mdc`).

6. Save files in .cursor/rules/

## Example Prompt

"Using the Meta-Rule for Crafting Cursor Project Rules based on our conversation here, create a new rule that outlines the coding standards for header files, including indentation, naming conventions, and documentation practices."
