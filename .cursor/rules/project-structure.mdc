## Introduction

These guidelines ensure consistent project organization and documentation maintenance across the CoMPhy Lab website codebase.

## Guidelines

### Repository Structure
- The README.md file at repository root serves as the primary documentation
- Templates are located in `_layouts/*.html`
- Each template has a corresponding CSS file:
  - `default.html` → `assets/css/styles.css`
  - `research.html` → `assets/css/research.css`
  - `team.html` → `assets/css/team.css`
  - All templates use `search.css` and `styles.css`

### Documentation Maintenance
- Keep README.md up-to-date with any structural changes
- Document any new files or directories added to the project
- Manual control over Jekyll server deployment is preferred

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to update README.md after structural changes
- Inconsistent template-to-CSS file mapping
- Running Jekyll server automatically instead of manual control
