## Introduction

These guidelines establish fundamental coding standards that apply across all file types in the project, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Guidelines

### Indentation and Formatting
- Use 2-space indentation consistently across all files
- Maintain consistent spacing around operators and blocks
- Follow language-specific formatting conventions

### Code Organization
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Reuse components, variables, and styles where possible
- Keep related code grouped together logically

### Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write self-documenting code where possible
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components

## Examples

```javascript
// Good - Self-documenting code with clear naming
const calculateTotalPrice = (basePrice, taxRate) => {
  return basePrice * (1 + taxRate);
};

// Bad - Unclear naming and unnecessary comments
const calc = (p, t) => {
  // multiply price by tax
  return p * (1 + t);
};
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Inconsistent indentation across different file types
- Code duplication instead of component reuse
- Over-commenting obvious code while under-documenting complex logic
