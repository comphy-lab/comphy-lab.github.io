Understanding the physics before implementation\n  Writing the first code in Basilisk C Getting comfortable with the framework\n  Solving conservation equations Numerical approaches to fluid dynamics\n  Interface tracking methods Capturing multiphase phenomena accurately\n  Non-Newtonian flows Modeling complex rheological behaviors This intensive 4-day course provides a comprehensive introduction to high-fidelity simulations using Basilisk C, a powerful computational framework for fluid dynamics. Participants will learn to implement and solve complex fluid mechanics problems with an emphasis on multiphase flows, interface dynamics, and non-Newtonian rheology. The course combines theoretical lectures with extensive hands-on sessions, allowing participants to immediately apply concepts through guided coding exercises.
