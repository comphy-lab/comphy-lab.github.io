These phenomena are critical to energy transitions and manufacturing. For instance, a key challenge is optimizing bubble detachment in electrolysis to boost efficiency. This research involves advanced numerical methods and industry partnerships, with the broader aim of advancing technologies from chemical reactors to printing processes.",

(2002), Walls et al. (2015), Deike et al. (2018)] and experimental data from ongoing parallel experiments.\n4. **Applications & Implications**  \n   - Relate findings to **aroma transport** in champagne, **aerosol generation** in pathogen-laden fluids, and **cloud formation** via marine aerosol.  \n   - Draw analogies to droplet formation in **coughing/sneezing**, focusing on the role of viscoelasticity in droplet sizes and distribution.",

    "content": "Thus, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$ encapsulates the `source` or `sink` behavior within the volume and is intimately connected to how $\\phi$ changes over time.",
